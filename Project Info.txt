I started coding this project in November 2022 right after I had my very first Python class.
The first code version you see here is actually version 1.3 already as I started with very basic commands and functions.

My goal is to achieve a food ordering app with UI and 100% functionality.
Yes, I know Python is not the best language to create mobile apps, but we all have to start somewhere, right?

Thanks!
